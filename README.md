This is a personal business card website designed to introduce myself as a software engineer and aspiring Full Stack developer. The site includes basic information about me, my skills, and ways to get in touch.

The main goal of this project was to improve my HTML and CSS skills while creating a simple, responsive, and visually clean web page.
